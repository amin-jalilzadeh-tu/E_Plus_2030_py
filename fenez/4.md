4. Summary of the required changes
   Keep your R_value_range / U_value_range definitions in data_materials_xxx. Let them be the main source of the “final R or U.”

After you pick the final R or U from data_materials_xxx, you go into material_lookup only to pick the remaining properties (like thickness, density, absorptance, etc.), but you do not treat “Conductivity_range” from the lookup as gospel. Instead, you recompute conductivity from the chosen R (or U).

This ensures that the final “R” or “U” truly matches data_materials_xxx (the priority), while all the other fields (like thickness, density) still come from material_lookup.

With these code tweaks, you’ll have a consistent approach where data_materials_residential (or non‐residential) leads on R/U values, and your material_lookup dictionary in materials_config.py supplies the rest of the physical properties.


* * For **windows** (`WINDOWMATERIAL:GLAZING`), we do a simple approximation:
    U≈ConductivityThickness    ⟹    Conductivity=U×Thickness U \approx \frac{\text{Conductivity}}{\text{Thickness}}
    \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
    \text{Conductivity} = U \times \text{Thickness}**U**≈**Thickness**Conductivity⟹**Conductivity**=**U**×**Thickness**
