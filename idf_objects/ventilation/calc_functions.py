    Calculate infiltration in m3/s based on an 'infiltration_base' at 10 Pa.

    Steps:
      1) Multiply infiltration_base by year_factor => qv10_lea_ref (represents
         infiltration at 10 Pa for the building, e.g. in dm3/sÂ·m2 or similar).
      2) Convert qv10 => qv1 by applying exponent:
            qv1 = qv10 * (1/10)^n
         (n = flow_exponent, e.g. 0.67 per NTA 8800).
      3) Multiply qv1_lea_ref_per_m2_h by total floor area => infiltration_m3/h.
      4) Convert infiltration_m3/h => infiltration_m3/s by dividing by 3600.

    NTA 8800 basis:
      - Table 11.2 prescribes n=0.67 for leak losses (infiltration).
      - Section 11.2.5 references how infiltration is often reported at 10 Pa
        and needs converting to 1 Pa. This code parallels that approach.

    Returns infiltration in m3/s.
